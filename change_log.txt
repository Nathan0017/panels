BUG FIXES:
1. test_dcb_before_opening and _tsl:
--- Fixed bugs related to using more than 2 panels per level

2. multidomain class:
-- calc_kC_conn: Fixed issue with random panel order for the TSL connection type

====================================================================================================

DEV:
1. multidomain class:
-- plot:
----- Added options to only compute (and return) results without plotting them
----- Added functionality to pass precalculated results to just plot them vs having to recalculate them every time the plot function is called. 
----- Created a common colourbar for all panel groups (using the prev dev)
----- Cleaned up the code to calculate results 
----- Modified plotting code (visual changes, added tick for 0)

2. multidomain class:
-- calc_results (added)
----- Calculates and returns results - makes it more accessible, helps normalize colourbars

3. test_dcb_before_opening and _tsl:
----- Can now switch between 2+ panels per level (experimental - to check if the TSL works)

====================================================================================================

KNOWN ISSUES:
1. DCB deform downwards upon applying an upward displacement 
2. Structure consisting of 2 and 3 panels have (slightly) different results

DEV: 
	Summary: Force calculation + gaussian grid point compatibility 
	
1. multidomain class:
-- force (NEW):
----- Calculates force over a constant x or y line for a specified panel
		Done by numerically integrating the stress field along that line
		
-- uvw, strain, stress:
----- Added generation of gaussian points (if required) 
----- Adding extra sampling points to the grid at the locations where force is requested (either x or y depending on request)

-- stress:
----- Functionality to compute stresses in a single panel (vs group) - used to compute forces
		
-- plot:
----- Modified boundary plotting code to also handle gaussian points

11-03-23 onwards:

DEV: Calc damaged stiffness + TSL penalty stiff matrix

1. kCSB (added):
-- Calculates penalty stiffness matrix for the damaged region with traction separation law by integrating over the concerned region

2. penalties:
-- Calculation of the out-of-plane stiffness per integration point across the entire contact interface
---- Considers damaged stiffness
---- Non-interpenetration constraint added by high penalty stiffness
---- No stiffness upon failure

3. test_dcb_damage:
-- Implemented nonlinear NR method to recreate a linear case (improved the residual term by adding the prescribed displacement's contribuition) 

4. Shell class:
-- Added error codes for non-existant orders of bardell functions

5. print_legendre_gauss_quadrature_C:
-- Changed 'write binary' (wb) to 'write' (w); and changed functions to support Py 3 (vs the older Py 2 earlier implemented)

6. legendre_gauss_quadrature.cpp (/panels/core/src):
-- Added weights and gauss points till 128 terms

18-03-23 onwards:

DEV: Damage Propagation (BUG: in interpenetration)

1. kCSB_dmg.pyx:
-- Fixed bugs involving wrong variables

2. penalties.py:
-- Calc damage index for each integration point
-- Added possibility to use k_SB (connection stiffness) when there is interpenetration 

3. multidomain.py:
-- Edited functions to include options to compute results for a single panel instead of a group
-- Fixed bugs in calc_separation - bug: Extracting results from the obtained ones

4. test_dcb_damaage.py:
-- test_kCconn_SB_damage: Test function for kCSB_dmg when there is no damage as a benchmark case
-- test_kw_tsl: Test function to calc kw_tsl, del_d (separation) and damage index across the panel
-- test_dcb_damage_prop: Test function to calculate damage propagation across the panel 
----- HAS BUGS - INTERPENETRATION PROBLEM UNSOLVED
